<h3> My Favorite Team Member </h3>
<p> My favorite member is Kiyoomi Sakusa, the team's ace and one of the top three high school aces in the country. <br/>
    He is a wing spiker and ace for the Itachiyama Institute volleyball team, known for being one of the top three high school aces in Japan. <br/>
    He is a meticulous and clean-freak character who is also known for his blunt honesty. <br/>
    His personality stems from his fear of germs and crowds, and his high level of personal hygiene is a key part of his character. </p>
